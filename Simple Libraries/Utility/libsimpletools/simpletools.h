 * @brief This library provides convenience functions 
 * for a variety of microcontroller I/O, timing, conversion, and 
 * communication tasks.  This library also includes (and you can 
 * call functions from) 
 * <a target="blank" href="../../../Text%20Devices/libsimpletext/
 * Documentation%20simpletext%20Library.html">simpletext</a> 
 * and
 * <a target="blank" href="../../../Text%20Devices/libsimpletext/
 * Documentation%20serial%20Library.html">serial</a>.  
 *
 * <b>NOTE:</b> If you want to update old projects to work with this version
 * of simpletools, you may need to manually use the Add Simple Library button
 * to add .../SimpleIDE/Learn/Text Devices/libsimpletext.  
 *
 * <b><i>CONSTRUCTION ZONE:</i></b> This library is still preliminary, 
 * revisions pending.
 * @n @n dac_ctr, square_wave, and all pwm functions, are currently  
 * only supported by the LMM and CMM memory models.  
 *
 * @details This (under development) library provides a set of
 * introductory functions that simplify:
 *  
 * @li I/O control - convenient I/O pin monitoring and control functions
 * @li Timing - Delays, timeouts
 * @li Timed I/O - pulse generation/measurement, square waves, transition
 * counting, RC decay, etc.
 * @li Analog - D/A conversion, PWM, and more.  
 * @n For A/D conversion see ...Learn/Simple Libraries/Convert
 * for A/D conversion libraries
 * @li Serial Communication - SPI, I2C
 * @n For half and full duplex asynchronous serial communication, see 
 * ...Learn/Simple Libraries/Text Devices
 * @li Memory - EEPROM, SD storage
 *
 * Applications include: monitoring, control and
 * communication with simple peripherals, like lights, buttons,
 * dials, motors, peripheral integrated circuits and prototyping with
 * simple systems that use pulse, or serial communication.  (A few
 * examples from the very large list of devices includes: servos,
 * ultrasonic distance sensors, accelerometers, serial liquid crystal,
 * display, etc.)
 *
 * Intended use: Accompanies introductory electronics, robotics and
 * programming lessons and projects on learn.parallax.com.  After
 * these lessons, bridge lessons will be added to familiarize the
 * programmer with standard practices used by the community for
 * adding libraries to support and endless variety of peripherals
 * and applications.
 *
 * Revision 0.91 shift_in function pre-clock mode bug fixed. @n @n
 * Revision 0.92 Simpletext functionality incorporated for use of
 * character and string I/O with both terminal and peripheral devices.
 * Simple Text folder replaces PropGCC serial driver support for simple
 * and full duplex serial peripherals. @n @n
 * Revision 0.93 i2c_newbus now uses @n
 *   .../Learn/Simple Libraries/Protocol/simplei2c/@n 
 * Added:@n
 *   i2c_out, i2c_in to cover most common I2C slave applications
 * EEPROM ee_get_* and ee_put_* changed to ee_get* and ee_put* where 
 * the * term is camel-case.
